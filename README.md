# Data-Mining-IRIS

Iris plants dataset is a well-known benchmark commonly used to test supervised machine learning problems. The four first attributes are numerical attributes, which gives measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width, and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from three different species of iris. They will be used for the clustering and as predictive attributes, but the class (the fifth attribute) can be used to test the validity of the clustering.
